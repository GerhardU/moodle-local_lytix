## Configuration

See [settings.md](https://github.com/llttugraz/moodle-local_lytix/blob/main/settings.md).

## Usage

The `local_lytix` plugin has three different modes of operation (`Learner's Corner`, `Creator's Dashboard` and `Course Dashboard`).

Switching between these three modes happens on global scope of the deployed Moodle instance and can be done under `Site administration` --> `Plugins` --> `LYTIX`.

One of the modes is selected in the `platform` dropdown and also additional settings are available there, other crucial one being list of courses for which the plugin is active.

After adding the course ID of the desired course and saving the changes the UI of the selected mode can be accessed on main course view in `More` dropdown.

`Creator's Dashboard` is shown only to course creators and managers and provides data about number of enrollments in the course, number of participants and graduates, and time they spent on specific areas.

`Learner's Corner` is available to both students and teachers but provide partially different functionalities depending on the role. Teachers can set events for all students and connect
them to specific existing activities like quizzes, which students can then mark as done. Students can also create their own custom events which are seen only by themselves, and also `Learning Diary` entries.

`Course Dashboard` can also be seen by both types of users, students can see their score and how it compares to other participants percentage-wise. Teachers in this mode again have additional data on activity completion by students and time-tracking details.
